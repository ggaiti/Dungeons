**Start of the game**

You are a Traveler from a far distant land. You have been traveling for quite some time in search for a stone that has been said to withhold infinite power. This stone can be the potential solution for your kind back home that are dying from famine and starvation, if you are succesfull you will be seen as a savior of your village and stories will be written about your jorney. The stone works from the creative mind of the beholder, anything you can think of can be made possible as long as you hold this stone and are strong enough to withstand its power. While on your Quest, you stumble upon a small town. Tired from your treck, you decided to pay the town a visit. A familiar aura fills this town, welcoming you with warmth. But not all seems right as you start to ask questions. You hope someone in this town has more information on where to find the stone and hopefully lead you to the right direction.

go to town, talk to tavern inhabitants, they will speak about a recent goblin problem they have been dealing with, no one has info on the stone but maybe the mystical creature of the forest might have some information, however she lives deep within the forest, the same forest that has been invaded by a recent goblin clan that moved in.

_kill the goblin leader in the dark woods_

after you talk to the dryad, she only knows little information about the stone but tells you her friend might know more. Her friend has been missing for a few days however and doesnt known where he left off to, all he told her was that he needed to take care of something but has not returned. Ever since he dissapeared a ferocious beast inhabited the nearby caves where her friend used to live and shortly after the goblins invaded the forest and started cutting down a section of it, maybe he is in danger and wants you to go check if he is safe.

_go to the caves and figure out what is lurking about_

you defeat the cursed druid, he tells you a great wizard cursed him and needs you to convince him to revert his curse, he was asked by a group of men in armor to retrieve a book from his tower and but wasnt given any details as to why they needed the book, however they promised him that his bounty will be forgiven if he suceeds. He wont bother the wizard if he gets turned back to normal and says he just wants to live peaceful life in the wilderner. He knows about someone that potentially can lead you to the stone if you decide to help him out.

_go to the watchtower to "talk" to the ArchMage_

the Archmage tells you the druid was trying to steal his book of forbidden magic. He gives you a bit more information of the stones capabilities but only has one possible outcome of who can potentially be withholding the stone and if it is who he thinks it is the lives of the inhabitants of the land might be in danger. he Gives you a potion for the druid and tells you of a nearby city but to be careful of the people running it and that he used to be the grand wizard of the academy but left shortly after and moved into the watchtower for good reasons. After giving the druid the potion he is able to turn back into normal and tells you that the men in the armor were from the royal family of the nearby city of Archania. he was wrongfully accused of a murder of a high profile women and it is the reason he lives out here in the caves away from civilization, thats when he stumbled upon the dryad and became friends with her. All he knows about the stone is that it can create anything from the mind of the beholder and that in the wrong hands it can be very devastating. but if you wants more information maybe go confront the royal knights and their leader that is a mighty paladin. He thinks something about the book they wanted could be connected to the stone.

_go to archania to find out more clues on the stone_

In archania you can ask people in the inn, tavern and shop, but they will all tell you how a section of the city is quarantined from the rest due to some sort of disease. however the palace is looking for valient volunteers to deal with the problem at the palace, you go to the palace and you get introduced to the knights and their leader paladin. You tell them you are there to deal with the problem and the king rightfully tells you to go to the downtown section of the city to find out the source of this diseaes that is turning everyone against each other and turning them into ravenous beast. the paladin and his royal knights are too busy defending the other part of the city from the ravenous diseased inhabitants so they do not have time to go with you or help. if you help the king can answer any of your questions

_go downtown and deal with the source of the problem_

you find out people are turning into zombies and getting possesed by demons so you go to to the center of downtown which has a chapel where you find a priest converting dead bodies into zombies and spreading the diseases to living people. He is also the one responsible for summoning and commading the demons and making them posses the living inhabitants, whoever opposes him will be killed and reanimated meanwhile the rest just get possesed. you must kill the priest which is actually a demon commander in disguise to stop the madness. once you are succesfull you report back to the king and fill him in on what was happening, the king can only think of one possible thing behind the spread and tells you to go to the layer of the demon queen and slay her for the madness to stop.

_go to the demon queens layer located in the depth of the mountains_

on your treck to through the mountains you encounter orcs, beast and different creatures that inhabit the path to the demon layer at the end there can be a dragon you can slay.

_Kill the demon queen_

when you get to the demon layer you need to fight your way to the demon queen. when you reach her she tells you how someone from the city allowed her inside and told her to take over the city. this gives you a perspective of there being a bigger influence in charge of the demon queen. so your adventure is not over. once you defeat her you go and report back to the king. he seems suprised that you are back alive but you dont question why he seems shock. next thing he tells you that your next mission is to escort his daughter to the nearby town of helm to keep her safe from what he heard was a great evil coming from the north. when you go into the daughters quarters you see her dead bleeding from a stab wound in her stomach. You try to see if she is ok and without thinking remove the dagger from her stomach but as soon as you do the royal knights enter the room and see you holding the dagger, you have been framed for the murder of the princess. you now must fight your way out of the palace from what seems to be some sort of corruption going on.

_escape the palace_

at the entrance towards the end you see the paladin haulting you and tells you how he was commanded by the king to frame you. you cant believe that someone with the responsiblity to protect the people would follow an order so senile as the king ordered to kill his own daughter. Later he tells you that the women that the druid was framed for was no other than the queen and the king also tasked him to frame the druid so he can bestow new laws on recruiting more militia and reinforcing his military power so they can become the most powerful kingdom in the lands. you must now fight the brainwashed paladin and his knights.

_Kill the Paladin_

before the palading dies he has a momment of clarity and realizes how he was brainwashed into thinking he was doing the right thing by following orders and realized the mistakes he has made. he tells you the king needed the book of forbidden magic because the king posseses the stone and is trying to unlock the dark powers the stone has to rule not only the land but the whole universe. he then says the king has a castle not too far from the city where he has been doing all kinds of experiments with the stone to unlock that dark magic. as he passes, you see more knights rush towards you so you quickly have to leave the the palace.

_prepare for your quest and head to the castle on the far hills_

on your way you go through a swampy area where you must fight some more creatures and eventually a goliath moss monster that has been dormant in the swamp for some time

once you reach the castle you realize that all of a sudden the area around you turns to night even if its only middday. when you head to the castle you are greeted by a big drawbridge which seems to be welcoming you in, as soon as you are about to cross you hear explosions from both sides and you fall to the pits where you end up at the basement of the castle, you must now fight your way up.

before you reach him somewhere in the castle you must fight 3 bosses, the jailer which is at the bottom. he is a troll. a warlock maybe somewhere in teh middle and third can be a hybrid beast before you reach him

once you reach the room where he recides, you see him looking outside the connected balcony of the open room. he starts giving a speech about how the land is filled with corruption and he wants to create a perfect world where there is no disorder or chaos. one where he can be the god and everyone will worship him, he is trying to use the stone to do this and wont let you get in his way.

_kill the king_

at first you strike the king down but right before you defeat him, in a last effort to achieve his plans, he swallows the stone, the power of it is so strong that he screams in pain and starts to mutate into a unrecognized beast, 4 wings come out of his back and his arms start to morth into different types of beast as well as his legs and grows a scaly spiky tail while horns come out of his forehead, extra limbs also come out of him. From what it seems this is the true power of the stone and what it is capable of doing, turning the king into what you can only pressume is some sort of deity. your only option is to give it all you got.

_second phase king, true form_

once you defeat the kind he repeats how its not possible and that the stone is supposed to grant him unlimited power. he becomes so unstable by the shere power of the stone that he rises to the sky and implodes. the blast was so powerful it was able to be heard across the land and so blindly that everyone everywhere was able to see the brightness of the explosion. the stone falls to the ground in front of you. finally your quest is over as you grab the stone and store it in your pouch, you use it to help all those places you visited and finally travel back home. you use it on the your land so crops are able to blossom no matter the season, and all diseases are cured by the water flowing in the rivers. you become the savior in your village and now that your quest is over, you do destroy the stone so nobody can ever use its powers for the wrong reasons. securing the future of your village and the whole world.
